| 1 | A simple histogram-of-oriented-gradients-descriptor extractor. |
| 2 | A simple image registration implementation using SIFT/RANSAC based initialization and inverse compositional alignment based refinement. |
| 3 | Simple image classification using tiny-image/bag-of-visual-words descriptor and knn/sv classifier. |
| 4 | A simple image classification implementation using perceptron variants and a convolution-layer-containing-network, all implemented from scratch. |
| 5 | Calculating disparity (and thus depth of the scene) using two images of a scene. |
